          Not gradudated from a computer science degree, but slowly found my
          interest in coding especially during this pandemic season. I had a lot
          of fun playing with different tools and definitely struggled too.
        </ProfileP>
        <ProfileP>
          Started with python and slowly ventured into React, still improving so
          this portfolio website is my little project to showcase what I have
          got.
        </ProfileP>
        <ProfileP>
          I'am excited to fill this space with more projects that I have done!
          Stay tuned!
